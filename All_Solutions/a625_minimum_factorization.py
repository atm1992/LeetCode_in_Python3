title: 最小因式分解
Given a positive integer num, return the smallest positive integer x whose multiplication of each digit equals num. If there is no answer or the answer is not fit in 32-bit signed integer, return 0.


Example 1:
Input: num = 48
Output: 68

Example 2:
Input: num = 15
Output: 35


Constraints:
1 <= num <= 2^31 - 1
